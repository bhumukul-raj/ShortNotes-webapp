Here’s an optimal folder structure for your Flask project that focuses on maintainability and scalability:

### Recommended Folder Structure:

```
my_flask_project/
│
├── app.py                     # Main Flask application file
├── models.py                  # Handles data manipulation (e.g., reading/writing JSON)
├── utils.py                   # Optional: Helper functions (e.g., for validations, transformations)
│
├── static/                    # Folder for static assets (CSS, JS, images)
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css          # Example CSS file
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── script.js          # Example JS file
│   └── images/                # Store image files
│       └── example.jpg
│
├── templates/                 # Folder for HTML templates
│   ├── base.html              # Base template (common layout for all pages)
│   ├── index.html             # Homepage template displaying subjects
│   ├── subject_page.html      # Template for individual subject pages
│   └── admin.html             # Admin panel template for CRUD operations
│
├── data/                      # Folder for JSON data storage
│   ├── subjects.json          # JSON file storing subject information
│   └── topics.json            # JSON file storing topic data for each subject
│
├── migrations/                # Optional: Folder for database migrations (if using SQLAlchemy in the future)
│
├── .gitignore                 # Git ignore file
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
└── README.md                  # Project documentation
```

### Explanation:

- **app.py**: Contains the main Flask routes and app configurations.
- **models.py**: Handles loading and saving JSON data, performing operations like adding, updating, and deleting subjects and topics.
- **utils.py**: Optional utility functions that can help with operations that don't belong in the models, such as input validation, date formatting, etc.
  
- **static/**: Contains all your static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images. Flask will serve these files automatically. You can add:
  - `css/` for styling
  - `js/` for JavaScript functionality
  - `images/` for storing images referenced in your HTML templates
  
- **templates/**: Stores all your HTML files. 
  - `base.html` is a base template that all other pages can extend from (helps reduce code duplication).
  - `index.html` displays subject cards with buttons.
  - `subject_page.html` renders the topics and subtopics for each subject.
  - `admin.html` is the admin panel to manage the CRUD operations.

- **data/**: Stores your JSON files.
  - `subjects.json`: Stores the list of subjects (id, name).
  - `topics.json`: Stores the topics for each subject, including subtopics and related details.

- **migrations/**: If you decide to use a database later, this folder will store your migration scripts (if using Flask-SQLAlchemy).

- **requirements.txt**: List of all Python packages needed to run your project (Flask, etc.). You can generate this file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.env`, etc.).

- **README.md**: Project documentation explaining how to set up and run the project, and any other relevant information.

### Additional Notes:
- This structure keeps your project modular and easy to manage. You can scale the project easily by adding more features (like authentication, database integration) without cluttering the main application.
- Using a base HTML template (`base.html`) reduces redundancy. Pages like `index.html`, `subject_page.html`, and `admin.html` can extend this base template and define only the unique content for each page.
